My Profile Description

I'm Lukas! I've got a lot of hobbies you probably don't care about.
Coding-wise, I am decent at Python and am trying to learn Java and/or C++.
I haven't been able to make a game or anything super fun with my coding skills yet, but hopefully, I can at some point.
I'd also like to code for my Robotics team and BPA.
My other hobbies are theater, band, swimming, and other random stuff.
